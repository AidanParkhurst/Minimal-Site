                My professor says that to survive in this world, everybody needs to sell something to somebody.<br>
                It's a simple realization, a succinct summary of the system we were born into.<br>
                He uses a lot of psychedelics, I'd bet that's when he came up with it.<br>
            </p> <p>
                Filling out job applications, I write down all my stats.<br>
                I need to sell myself first, before I can sell my time.<br>
                It's hard to get responses, there are a lot of people on the market.<br>

                Two days ago, I sold <a href="https://robhillrealtor.com">a website</a>.<br>
                I felt proud, I like selling websites much more than selling myself.<br>
            </p> <p>
                Yesterday, I tried to sell another, to the brand new noodle shop next door.<br>
                They were kind, but I felt embarrassed even asking.<br>
            </p> <p>
                In the future, I want to sell you a game.<br>
            </p> <p>
                Until then, I made some free ones for you to play.<br>
